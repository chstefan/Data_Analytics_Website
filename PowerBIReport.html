                Power BI Assessment on OECD Well-Being Data
              </h2>

                A Global Perspective on Ecomonics and Well-Being

            <section>
              <p>
                As part of the MT412 Business Analytics Portfolio, our Power BI assessment delved into the comprehensive OECD Well-Being Dataset, presented on 21st March 2024 in Dublin, Ireland. This project aimed to leverage Power BI’s dynamic capabilities for in-depth data analysis, visual reporting, and insightful discovery into economic and well-being indicators across OECD countries. The dataset, provided by the OECD in 2017, encompasses 34 topics reflecting a wide spectrum of societal well-being, structured and cleaned for conducive analysis.

              />
              <p>
                Our objective was to engage with the dataset to unearth meaningful insights and contribute to the broader discourse on societal well-being, thereby empowering policy-making processes. Through meticulous analysis, we aimed to conceptualize, organize, and prioritize our findings, presenting a comprehensive and impactful view of well-being across the globe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our approach involved several key steps: validating data integrity, conducting basic feature engineering, and aligning indicators with research and policy interests. We utilized Power BI’s built-in statistical functions to explore data relationships, created dashboards for multivariate analysis visualizations, and designed interactive reports to communicate our findings effectively.
              </p>
              <p>
                The analysis dissected critical economic and well-being indicators, revealing significant correlations and insights. For instance, we found that life expectancy positively correlates with GDP per Capita and the quality of support networks, while negatively affected by the homicide rate and the availability of basic dwelling facilities. Moreover, our exploration highlighted the disparities in environmental quality, personal earnings, and life satisfaction across OECD countries, with countries like Iceland, Switzerland, and the Nordic nations standing out for their high life satisfaction scores.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our Power BI assessment underscored the profound impact of economic indicators, quality of life, employment, and education on societal well-being. We discovered impactful correlations, such as the positive relationship between personal earnings and factors like rooms per person, water quality, safety, and overall life satisfaction. These findings illustrate the significant role of a country’s economic status in shaping its citizens' well-being.
              </p>

                This comprehensive narrative provides a formal and structured overview of your Power BI assessment on OECD Well-Being Data, suitable for inclusion in a professional data analytics portfolio. Our presentation was complemented by interactive dashboards that provided a detailed overview of key economic indicators, employment and education trends, quality of life metrics, and insightful correlations within OECD countries. These dashboards allow for an immersive exploration of the data, facilitating a deeper understanding of the intricate relationships between different well-being factors.
              </p>
              <p>
                This Power BI assessment has been a profound journey into the heart of societal well-being data, offering a global perspective on the economics of happiness and prosperity. By harnessing the power of data analytics, we have been able to contribute to the ongoing dialogue on well-being and provide valuable insights for policy-making. Our findings underscore the necessity of data-driven decision-making in shaping a better world for all.
